# Flutter clickable SVG regions (Interactive Map)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gi097/flutter_clickable_regions.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/gi097/flutter_clickable_regions)

This is a simple application which displays an SVG image with clickable regions.
It displays all the provinces from The Netherlands. When you click on it, 
it will highlight the clicked province.

## Getting Started
Get an SVG and open it in a text editor. In this example, we are using the SVG image
from https://mapsvg.com/maps/netherlands/.

The file will show several ```<path></path>``` entries. You need to add these manually
in all the `@SvgPath` annotations.

After adding the annotations, you can run the below command to generate the needed
`Path` objects.

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

## Known issues
Some provinces are not clickable. This is an issue of the SVG being used.
